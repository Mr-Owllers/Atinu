                <p>this is the official site of Atinú, my conlang.</p>
                <h2>What is Atinú??</h2>
                <p>
                    Atinú is a conlang i made for daily use and literature (like poetry!)<br>
                    it takes inspiration from many languages, including but not limited to:<br>
                    - Proto-Indo-European<br>
                    - Latin<br>
                    - Proto-Germanic<br>
                    - Japanese<br>
                    - etc? (i forgor :skull:)
                </p>
                <h2>Why did I make Atinú?</h2>
                <p>
                    like i said, i made Atinú for daily use and literature.
                    i wanted to make a language that was easy to learn and use,
                    but also had a lot of depth and complexity to it.<br>
                    i also wanted to make a language that was unique and interesting,
                    and that i could use to express myself in ways that i couldn't with other languages. :D
                </p>
                <h2>How can I learn Atinú?</h2>
                <p>
                    well, this is why i made this site! :D<br>
                    you can learn Atinú by using the dictionary and grammar sections of this site,
                    and by reading the resources i've provided.<br>
                    you can also contact me if you have any questions or need help with anything! (there's also a discord server!)
                </p>
                <h2>What can I do with Atinú?</h2>
                <p>
                    well what do you usually do with languages?<br>
                    lol just do that! talk to people, write stuff, make art, etc.<br>
                    do whatever, it's just a language lol!
                </p>
                <h2>Can I use Atinú for my own stuff?</h2>
                <p>
                    do you use english for your own stuff? then yes!<br>
                    you can use Atinú for whatever you want, as long as you credit me for it ig.<br>
                    you can even use it to derive your own conlang if you want! :D (just credit me for that too lol :P)<br>
                    just have fun with it! :3
                </p>
                <h2>Can I help with Atinú?</h2>
                <p>
                    my main goal is making a naturalistic language that is easy to learn and use, but also unique and interesting.<br>
                    how can it be natural without you!<br>
                    of course you can help! just by using Atinú, it'll grow over time.<br>
                    and if you want to add something to this website, just make a pr in the site's repo and i'll approve it if it's good! ^-^
